# Silex Demo Project

A simple example project meant to support a workshop introducing [Silex](http://www.silex-project.org/).

Chapters are organized in branches to allow easy switching when following along. Note that you need to install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) and use it to install vendor libraries in later chapters.
